# Pymacautical_Challenge
Assignments demonstrating my work at the GW bootcamp 

Hello, attached is a completed copy of my pymacautical challenge. The first pie chart shows the total number of rows per drug regimen. Each bar has a distinked color related to a unique drug regiment. Propivia recorded the lowest number of observation for mouse time points, while capomulin recorded the highest.

From our stats, the distribution of male vs female mice was almost even as males registered 51% while females registered 49%.

Looking at the data, we also found out that capomulin and Ramicane registered some mild outliers after we calculated the final tumor volume accrross 4 treatment regimens and merging this data with the original data.

We equally registered the strong positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume. Meaning the higher the weight, the more the tumors.

The median line of best fit went to confirm our analysis on the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume with a correlation coefficient of 0.84. Looking at out scattered plot , we could see some of our outliers as confirmed by a previous chart,
